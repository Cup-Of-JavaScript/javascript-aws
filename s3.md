# S3
- S3 is a FLAT object store.  It is NOT a hierarchical system like the file system on our computer
- Yes, you can create a "folder" but its not a "real" folder.  A folder is an object that has 0 bytes.

`aws s3api list-objects --bucket siu-avb-bucket`
```
{
    "Contents": [
        {
            "Key": "my-folder/",
            "LastModified": "2022-08-05T14:50:43+00:00",
            "ETag": "\"d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e\"",
            "Size": 0,
            "StorageClass": "STANDARD",
            "Owner": {
                "DisplayName": "mburolla+aws",
                "ID": "0929b9dbdd789ef58ee8abc438f193b58ac5418020a1bbb997019093363728d7"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

- Bucket names must be globally unique
