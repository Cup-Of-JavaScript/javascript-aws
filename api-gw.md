# API Gateway

- ReST API (public/private) (Lambda Proxy or Integration)
- HTTP API (light version: Lambda Proxy only)
- Web Sockets

# API Gatway & Lambda

- Proxy: API GW acts as a dumb pass through, simply wrapping requests to lambda
- Integration: API GW can inspect and interact requests & responses using VTL

# Pricing
